# Pneumonia X-Ray Classifier (FastAPI)

A lightweight end-to-end project that trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on chest X-ray images and deploys it using **FastAPI**. The application provides both a **REST API** and a **minimal web interface** to classify X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.
